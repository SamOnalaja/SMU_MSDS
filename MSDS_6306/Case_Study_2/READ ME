This folder contains material used for Case Study 2 as part of SMU's MSDS 6306 course.

This project uses the given data sets in this folder to attempt to build a model and predict attrition based on selected variables.
The data set includes 37 variables and over 1100 observations.

Subset function was performed on the data set and the variables with the lowerst BIC were selected to develop the primary model.
From there the model was adjusted to 7 and then once again to 3 variables in order to maximize efficiency and effectiveness. 

The results showes that the first model was 86% accurate and the final model was 84% accurate, which is great considering it was only
using a fraction of the avaiable variables.
