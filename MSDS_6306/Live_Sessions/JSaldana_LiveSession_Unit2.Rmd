#1. (20 points) Put the following questions into RMarkdown as headers (or subheaders if you're making question numbers headings). Be sure to answer the questions underneath each header.

##  a. What is a basic workflow for reproducible research?
The three basic stages are as follows:

* Data Gathering
* Data Analysis
* Results Presentation

##  b. What are five practical tips for making research reproducible?
1.  Document Everything!
2.  Everything is a (text) file.
3.  All files should be human readable.
4.  Explicitly tie your files together.
5.  Have a plan to organize, store, and make your files available.

##  c. Give an example of how you might implement each tip.

**1.  Document Everything!**
  * One way to implement this tip is to record the session info. This allows others the ability to be able to see if any specific packages were loaded in order to achieve the same results. The code is as follows:
```
sessionInfo()
```

**2.  Everything is a (text) file.**

  * Storing all of the code in a text (.txt) file helps preserve the data. Unlike other files (.docx, .xlsx, etc.), the text file is nimble and is readable by most software code readers. It also doesn't change so the file extension will remain compatible for a long period.
  
**3.  All files should be human readable.**

  * Code is how machines communicate. Yet, it is not the easiest way to read code. Instead, commenting the code will allow readers (and even yourself) to go back and pick up right where you left off at that time.
  
**4.  Explicitly tie your files together.**

  * Document links between all of the (text) files utilized. If a graph is going to be referenced, ensuring the source of the model is avaiable is critical to ensure the reader is able to trace it back to the source.
  

**5.  Have a plan to organize, store, and make your files available.**

  * Organizing the files and they content helps the reader to be able to put the research together again. Think of it as a puzzle. Making all the files available is making sure a 100 piece puzzle has 100 pieces. Storing the files securely ensures the pieces won't go missing. Organizing is the critical component to ensure it is easy to put together. Unlike a puzzle, others don't want to have to guess and map the final image together. Instead, they want to be able to reproduce it in the most time efficient manner possible. This means putting all the edge pieces togther, and so on.
  

##  d. Which one of these do you think will be the most difficult?

  The most difficult would be to have a plan to organize, store, and make the files available. When conducting research, our workspace becomes our organized chaos. Everything may seem out of order to an outsides, but to us, we know exactly where it is. This makes the need to go back and reorganize everything that much more difficult. Why would I put my keys away in the key hanger if I know where is the last place I left them? Because other's may want to borrow my keys and they wouldn't know where to look without asking me.
  
#2. (20 points) Download and complete "air_hist.R" code from the Files tab on 2DS. You will build scatter plots using the plot function.

## a. As described in the “TODO Assignment 2: Question 2a” comment, complete the plot function regarding monthly temperature.

Refer to 2.c for final code.

##  b.	As described in the “TODO Assignment 2: Question 2b” comment, complete the plot function involving ozone.

Refer to 2.c for final code.

##  c.	Translate these to RMarkdown and put them in your overall homework RMarkdown file.

```{r echo = TRUE}

# air_hist.R - Unit 2 Live Session Homework
###################################################################################
# Note: Please reformat these to place into your RMarkdown submission document.
# You can make sure it works here, but make it easy for your grader via RMD
###################################################################################

# You are responsible for the TODOs, but the complete code here will give you
# an idea of what the data look like.  Remember, you might need some of this code 
# directly in your response file to make it work, even if it's not TODO!!

# We will be using the built-in dataset airquality which has daily air quality 
# measurements in New York from May to September 1973
str(airquality)

# Take only Temp columns
Temperature <- airquality$Temp
hist(Temperature)

# Histogram with added parameters
hist(Temperature,
     main="Maximum daily temperature at La Guardia Airport",
     xlab="Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit",
     xlim=c(50,100),
     col="darkmagenta",
     freq=FALSE
)

# TODO: Assignment 2, Q2A: Complete the following code to yield a scatterplot with x as Month and y as Temp
# You're going to customize your plot slightly.  Use the help function to assist you if needed.
# Make the x label "Month" and the y label "Temperature"
# Finally, make the title of the plot "Temperature by Month" 

#Assigning Month column to 'Month'
Month <- airquality$Month

plot(Month, Temperature, main = "Temperature by Month")


# TODO: Assignment 2, Q2B: Build a scatter plot with x as Temperature and y as Ozone 
# Complete the following code:
# Make the x label "Temperature" and the y label "Ozone",
# Make the title of the plot "Temperature vs Ozone"

#Assigning Ozone column to 'Ozone'
Ozone <- airquality$Ozone

plot(Temperature, Ozone, main = "Temperature vs Ozone")
```

#3.	(20 points) Download and complete “knit_cars.Rmd” in the Files tab on 2DS. 

##  a.	As described in the “TODO Assignment 2: Question 3a” comment, complete a plot function for Temperature and Pressure

Refer to 3.c for final code.

##  b.	As described in the “TODO Assignment 2: Question 3b” comment, complete a similar plot function that reverses the two axes.

Refer to 3.c for final code.

##  c.	This is written in RMarkdown, so just transfer it to your RMarkdown script.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

<!--
Note to you, the student:
This is already in RMarkdown, so it should be easy to implement in your overall HW RMarkdown file.
You only need to include the TODOs for HW submission, but keep in mind that you might need other code to create objects the TODO uses!
-->

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r cars_plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

## Including Plots
```{r pressure_data}
summary(pressure)
```

You can also embed plots as default, for example:
<!--
TODO: Assignment 2: 3A, complete the following scatter plot. 
The x axis is pressure, while the y axis is temperature
Please title the graph "Temperature vs Pressure"
-->
```{r pressure_plot, echo=FALSE}
#Assigning the variables for use in plot function
Pressure <- pressure$pressure
Temperature <- pressure$temperature
plot(Pressure, Temperature, main = "Temperature vs Pressure" )
```

Now flip it!

<!--
TODO: Assignment 2: 3B, complete the following scatter plot:
x axis is pressure, y axis is temperature,
Label the x axis as "Pressure" and the y axis as "Temperature", 
Title the graph as "Pressure vs Temperature"
-->

```{r pressure_plot2, echo=FALSE}
#Plot flipping the variables used in the previous plot
plot(Temperature, Pressure, main = "Pressure vs Temperature")
```
