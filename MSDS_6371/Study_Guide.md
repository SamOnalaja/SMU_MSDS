# Quiz Q&A
**Q1.1**
In the motivation for the creativity study (page 2 of text), the poems were given to the judges in random order (though all judges graded all poems). Why was that important?
> Without randomization, the effect of motivation on creativity would be confounded with order of judging.

**Q1.3**
In 1930, an experiment was conducted on 20,000 school children in England. Teachers were responsible for randomly assigning their students to a treatment group – to receive ¾ pints of milk each day – or to a control group – to receive no milk supplement. The study found that children receiving milk gained more weight during the study period. On further investigation, it was also found that the controls were heavier and taller than the treatment group before the milk experiment began. What is the likely explanation and its implication concerning the validity of the experiment?
> The teachers probably did not really randomize the students. They probably
chose students who weighed less to receive the milk supplement; therefore, the results
of the study are questionable.

**Q1.5**
What is the difference between a randomized experiment and a random sample?
> Random sample refers to how sample members (study participants) are selected from the population for inclusion in the study. Randomized experiment is an aspect of experimental design in which study participants are assigned to the treatment or control group using a random procedure.

**Q2.1**
True or False: If a sample size is large, then the shape of a histogram of the sample data will be approximately normal, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution.
>False

**Q2.2**
Suppose the following statement is made in a statistical summary:

*A comparison of breathing capacities of individuals in households with low nitrogen dioxide levels and individuals in households with high nitrogen dioxide levels indicated that there is no difference in the means (two-sided p-value = 0.24).*

What is wrong with this statement?
> Finding in favor of the null hypothesis does not necessarily mean that that the difference in mean nitrogen dioxide levels between the two groups is 0, it means that the difference could plausibly be zero.

**Q2.3**
The data in Display 2.14 (page 53 in the text) are survival times (in days) of guinea pigs that were randomly assigned to a control group or to a treatment group that received a dose of tubercle bacilli. Which of the following models would be most appropriate for these data?
> The model would need to take into account a shift in mean as well as changes in variability between the treatment groups.

**Q3.1**
A woman who has just moved to a new town discovers two routes to drive from her home to work. The first Monday, she flips a coin, deciding she will take route A if it comes up heads and route B if it is tails. The following Monday, she will take the other route. The first Tuesday, she flips the coin again with the same plan, and so on for the first week. At the end of two weeks, she has traveled both routes five times and can compare their average commuting times. What tool should she use for comparing the average commuting times of the two routes?
> She should use a paired t-test.

**Q3.2**
In which ways are the t-tools more robust for large sample sizes than for smaller ones.
> Robustness to departures from normality.

**Q3.3**
Examine the fish oil data in exercise 1.12 (page 24 of the text). True or False: a logarithmic transformation is appropriate for these data.
> True.

**Q3.4**
Respiratory breathing capacity of individuals in houses with low levels of nitrogen dioxide was compare to the capacity of individuals in houses with high levels of nitrogen dioxide. From a sample of 200 houses of each type, breathing capacity was measured on 800 individuals in houses with high nitrogen dioxide, and 600 individuals in houses with low levels. What problem do you foresee in applying t-tools to these data?
> Measurements on individuals within the same household are probably not independent.

**Q4.1**
Suppose two drugs are both effective at prolonging life after a heart attack. Substantial statistical evidence indicates that the mean length of life for those using drug A is greater than the mean length of life for those using drug B, but the variation in the life length for drug A is substantially greater, as well. Why is it difficult to conclude that the drug A is better, even though the mean life length is greater?
> More people who use drug A might die sooner than those that use drug B.

**Q4.2**
In a certain problem on page 24 of the text, the randomization test produces an exact two-sided p-value of 0.053, while the t-distribution approximation produces a p-value of 0.047. One might say that since the p-values are on opposite sides of 0.05, they lead to quite different conclusions and, therefore, the approximation is not adequate. Which statement below is correct?
> The statement takes the cutoff of 0.05 too seriously. The difference between 0.047 and 0.053 is small; therefore the t-test approximation is good

**Q5.1**
What does it mean if the F-statistic is so small that the chance of getting an F-statistic that small or smaller from an ANOVA separate means test is only, say, 0.0001, given the null hypothesis is true?
> We reject the null hypothesis that the population means are equal.

**Q5.2**
Suppose an ornithologist is trying to distinguish between 9 species of flycatchers. He measures the relative size of the wing length to the tail length as a way to distinguish the species. The following table shows the average wing length minus the tail length for 24 birds in each species. Why can we not make a conclusion based on the averages alone?
> There is no measure of variability within groups given.

**Q5.3**
Four methods of growing wheat are to be compared on five farms. Four plots are used on each farm and each method is applied to one of the plots. Five measurements are therefore obtained on yield per acre for each of the four growing methods. Is one-way ANOVA an appropriate method for analyzing these results?
> No. Measurements for each method were taken on plots from the same farm

**Q6.1**
Recall the handicap study (case 6.1.1). Is it possible that the applicant’s handicap in the videotape is confounded with the actor’s performance?
> Yes. The actor who played the applicant could be more convincing in some roles than in others.

**Q6.2**
For the handicap study, who were the subjects?
> The undergraduates

**Q6.3**
Again for the handicap study, suppose that the researchers wanted to examine the effect of the control group versus each of the other groups (i.e. control vs. crutches, control vs. hard of hearing, etc). What multiple comparison procedure is the most appropriate?
> Dunnett’s procedure.
